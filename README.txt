Viz.js
======

A hack to put Graphviz on the web. You should probably check out dagre, though:

  https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre
  https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3

To render as SVG (produces an XML string):

  svg = Viz("digraph { a -> b; }", "svg");

This project is based on work by Satoshi Ueyama and Brenton Partridge:
